Charades! But not what you know.
In this version of charades, two teams compete in three rounds to have the most correctly guessed items from a pot of items made by the players of both teams!
Generally, a minute is given to each actor and this can be set by the creator of the round that you can join.
Each round puts different restrictions on the actor.

In the first round, any words and any actions are allowed.
In the second round, 1 word and any actions are allowed. No more than one word. If more than one word is spoken by the actor, the current item is discarded.
In the third round, NO words are allowed but once again actions are allowed.

This sounds difficult, and it would be if we got new words for each round, but the pot of words stays consistent between rounds.

This app does not enforce these rules, other than time. It is up to the players to keep the gameplay honest and fair, as always.

This app is meant to be a web based, session joining hoster of this charades game. It allows users to create sessions and share a code with others to have them join that session.

Each member of a session is required to put in certain number of prompts for charades, which is set by the session host.

This app will keep count for the number of completed items for each team and declare a winner at the end. Team names and representative colors can be set in the session creation screen.
The creator of the session can join the game if they so choose, but this is not required.
